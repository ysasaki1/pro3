    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Engaging in both academic research and a start-up business addressing parent-child conflicts, particularly within the performing arts industry. His scholarly focus is on the historical and comparative study of child actor policy- and law-making processes in East Asia, the United States, and Europe. He positions this field as an interdisciplinary area, bridging ethnomusicology and jurisprudence. He also has a keen interest in researching how Western legal systems can appropriately interact with indigenous cultures and analogous institutions such as Japan's "Iemoto system." In the business realm, he currently aims to provide services that address issues arising from new phenomena akin to child actors, known as "kid influencers."</p>
